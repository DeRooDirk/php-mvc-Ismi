# BeConnect :calling:

## The idea :bulb:

We wanted to work out a social media website for all the BeCode alumni where everyone can access the profiles. You are able to register a profile, add data and see others profiles. When you're logged in, you are able to add info about yourself (education, job experience, profile picture, ...) and you can communicate your experience or just add something fun in the BeConnect blog!

## Working out the project :question:

These concepts we wanted to work out for our project:

- a working register, login/logout system that is synced with a database :white_check_mark:
- a website that changes its content and options when logged in :white_check_mark:
- all the data that is added should be linked to the right profile and loaded in the right profile :white_check_mark:
- have a profile picture :white_check_mark:
- when you share your GitHub username, you are able to see all your (most popular) repo's
- a formal, yet welcoming look and feel :white_check_mark:
- a forum/blog page where you can see all the posts, also who wrote it and when :white_check_mark:
  - people can like posts that were written by others so you can see which ones were more popular than others
  - you can react on a blog post

## What parts are done :heavy_check_mark:

We managed to work out the majority of all the concepts we had in mind. Though, due to the timing we had to cut some of the nice-to-have extra's. Every point that has a checked marker next to it, is considered done.

## What parts can still be added :clipboard:

These are the parts that we didnt manage to finish, but would like to:

- sync with GitHub API and show repo's per profile
- a more interactive blog page

Some smaller parts that still need some attention have been added to the Issues page of this repository.

## Tools used :hammer_and_wrench:

We were offered a MVC boilerplate to start. Then we could link all the different pages and classes where needed.
